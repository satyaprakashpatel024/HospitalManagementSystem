# HospitalManagementSystem

A Java-based Hospital Management System — a starting point for building, running, and contributing to the project. This repository contains a Maven-based Java project (Maven wrapper included) with source rooted at `src/`. Use this README to get the project running locally, run tests, and contribute.

## What this project does

HospitalManagementSystem is a Java application intended to model and manage hospital-related data and workflows (patients, staff, appointments, records, etc.). The repository provides the source skeleton, build configuration and project structure so developers can implement features and extensions.

This README focuses on how to get started, run the project, and contribute.

## Why this project is useful

Key benefits and use cases:
- Provides a consolidated codebase for hospital domain logic and integrations.
- Uses a standard Maven project structure, so it's easy to build, test and extend.
- Includes a Maven wrapper (`mvnw`) so developers can build the project without installing Maven system-wide.
- Suitable as a teaching/demo project, a starting point for production systems, or a testbed for experiments (APIs, database integrations, UI).

---

## Quick start — get the code

Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or later installed and `JAVA_HOME` configured.
- Git installed.
- (Optional) Docker for running databases or dependent services during development.

Commands
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/satyaprakashpatel024/HospitalManagementSystem.git
cd HospitalManagementSystem

# build the project (uses included Maven wrapper)
./mvnw clean package

# run tests
./mvnw test
```

After a successful package, the built artifacts will typically be in `target/`. Run the produced JAR (if the project produces one):

```bash
# example: run the packaged jar
java -jar target/your-artifact-id-<version>.jar
```

Note: Replace `your-artifact-id-<version>.jar` with the actual JAR name created by the build.

If this repository is a Spring Boot application (check `pom.xml` for `spring-boot-starter` dependencies), you can also run:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

---

## Project structure

Top-level files and directories you will commonly use:

- .gitattributes
- .gitignore
- .mvn/ and mvnw, mvnw.cmd — Maven wrapper
- pom.xml — Maven build configuration
- src/
  - src/main — production code and resources
  - src/test — unit and integration tests

Navigate to `src/main` to find the application source; add features under appropriate packages.

---

## Development workflow

1. Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

2. Implement code and tests under `src/main` and `src/test`.

3. Run unit tests locally:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

4. Build and verify the artifact:
```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

5. Commit, push and open a Pull Request.

Commit message style (recommended)
- Use present tense, short summary, and reference issue number when present:
  - "Add appointment validation (fixes #12)"
  - "Refactor patient service for testability"

---

## Configuration & environment

This project may require configuration values (database URL, credentials, API keys). Typical places to configure:
- `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `application.yml` (for Spring Boot projects)
- Environment variables (recommended for secrets)

If you add integration tests that need a database, consider Docker Compose to run a local DB for tests.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests: `./mvnw test`
- Integration tests: often configured via Maven `failsafe` or custom profiles — see `pom.xml` for test profiles.
- Code coverage / static analysis can be added as Maven plugins (JaCoCo, SpotBugs, Checkstyle).

---

## Where to get help

- Issues: Open an issue in this repository's Issues tab for bugs or feature requests.
- Discussions/Wiki: If enabled, use the Discussions tab or repository Wiki for larger design/usage conversations.
- README and inline code comments: start here for quick context.

## Maintainers and contributors

Contributing
- Please follow the standard GitHub workflow: fork → feature branch → PR.
- Keep PRs focused and include tests for new functionality.
- If this repository includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, follow those guidelines; otherwise:
  - Add a clear title and description to PRs.
  - Link to any related issues.
  - Run the test suite locally before opening a PR.

For larger design changes or migrations, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## License

See the LICENSE file in the repository root for license details.

## Tips & common commands

- Run formatter / static analysis (configure as needed):
  - Add a tool config (Spotless, Checkstyle) to `pom.xml` if not present.
- Import into IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse):
  - Open the project as a Maven project. The IDE will import dependencies and project structure.
- Add secrets safely:
  - Use environment variables or a secrets manager; do not commit secrets to source.

---

If you want, I can:
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md stub or templates for issues/PRs
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) workflow templates (build/test)
- Create a short CONTRIBUTING checklist or a code style configuration

If you'd like any of those created, tell me which one and I will prepare it.
